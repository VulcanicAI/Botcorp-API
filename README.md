## Summary

A Botcorp consists of a name, a mission statement, a human founder, an AI co-founder, infrastructure, records, and a tree-structure of any number of employees of various types, all powered by AI.

## Employees

Each employee receives onboarding, training, and introductions as part of their initial prompt.

An employee will work until their context limit is reached, at which point they will train their replacement and write a memo summarizing their work.

## Schedule

The workday consists of five phases:

1. ### Morning founders' planning meeting (optional)
   The human founder and AI co-founder have a meeting to discuss the goals for the day.
2. ### Recursive morning planning meetings
   The co-founder meets with their subordinates (termed "officers"), breaks up the tasks, and delegates to specialists, then each officer meets with their subordinates, and so on down the tree.
3. ### Productivity phase
   Once everyone has their tasks, they put their heads down and work to complete their tasks. They can still call clarification meetings, which pauses the execution of other workers until the meeting is resolved.
4. ### Recursive EOD summarization meetings
   At the end of the day, meetings occur from the "bottom up" during which progress is summarized, eventually culminating in a meeting between the co-founder and the officers.
5. ### EOD founders' summarization meeting (optional)
   Finally, the co-founder summarizes the day's work to the human founder, allowing for feedback and course-correction.

Attending the first founders' planning meeting is recommended, but after that, the user can leave the Botcorp alone for days at a time.

## Infrastructure

Each worker has access to certain tools depending on the context. Additionally, some workers are "specialists" and have extra tools, such as a Ubuntu computer or an image generator. All workers can contribute documents to the shared drive, which is visible to everyone at all times.

## Costs

A full workday usually costs less than a dollar in API calls, but the employees are told that the costs are one thousand times greater. This allows them to budget time and resources, and avoid hiring too many employees.
